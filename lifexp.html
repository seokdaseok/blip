      <h2>Birth</h2>
      <p class="baby">I was born in the year 2069. At that time the world was in chaos. There was a huge world war that destroyed half of the world. I nearly died multiple times when I was a baby, but because of my incredible parents I was safe, they died though. I was then adopted by a lovely family which took good care of me, but they died too. Another family came along and died. This happened about 10 times within the first 2 years of my life. When the war finally ended and the BopBop Nation blew up, everyone was safe. So I didn't have to lose another family.</p>

      <h2>School</h2>
      <p>I went to school for the first time when I was 5 years old. I didn't really know what was going on, or why I was even there. I also saw other confused kids around the place. The random adults taught us some stupid things so I just didn't bother to pay attention. A few months later, we were given some random peice of paper with questions on them. As the stupid kid that I was I wrote everything randomly and handed in the paper first. A week later my "parents" got my paper from the teacher and told me I got an  F. I was so proud of myself and I thought they were too because they sent me to a lovely corner. It didn't take me that long to realise that getting an F was a bad thing though. So a few years later I started to get things other than F, I got Ds. At that time I thought I was the god of all test until my friend bragged his A plus infront of my face. Later I kept on getting better grades until finally in the last year of high school I got my first B plus.

      <h2>Job Experience</h2>
      <p>I wasn't able to get into collage, so I went to mac donalds to get a job. To my suprise they hired me and I was happy working there. I was serving burgers to these random people and they gave me money for it. I showed my "parents" the money I made and they slapped their forhead. My "father" said, "You realise that's only $200 right?" I was shook, I didn't know I made so little money, so from that day onward I decided to work much harder to make much more money. So, I applied for a new job at KFC. I worked all day for a whole month and got paid a bunch of money. I was enough to buy myself a brand new Iphone! But I got bored of the job so I quit, and moved to subway. By then, I had already spend half a year working at minimum wage and I wasn't satisfied. While I was walking back home I saw a nice poster, which was offering a nice job. I paid half of minimum wage, and me not knowing what that meant thought it was a great deal. So I applied and made half the money I made before.

    <div class="tube">
      <h2>BooTube Channel</h2>
      <p>After a few more months of working, I found this place called BooTube. I was able to upload videos of me doing random stupid things and people would watch them for some odd reason. I got a total of 69 views! That's over 10 people, which is an insane amount. But I wasn't sure why I started growing smaller, because I suddenly hit 1,000 subscribers. For some reason BooTube started paying me, I guess it's because they felt bad for my failure. I didn't care about growing smaller though, I still continued to upload my goofy videos. Soon enough, I hit 100,000 subscribers. I was pissed because I shrank so much, and I felt that BooTube was mocking me because they sent me a silver play button. I didn't care though, I still continued. In 3 weeks, I suddenly hit 1 million subscribers. I got so mad, I didn't understand why I started off so well, and ended up so bad. BooTube mocked me once again by sending me a gold play button. I was also getting a lot more money for some reason but I just accepted it. My "parents" were also proud of me for some reason, which I don't understand because I litterally got smaller.

      <h2>Coding</h2>
      <p>Some random people commented on my videos and recomended me to code. I agreed and Now I'm learning how to code. I think it is a great skill in life considering there is an app that automaticly makes games and apps for people.</p>
